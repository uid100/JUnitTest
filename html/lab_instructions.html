        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>Follow the guided instructions in the video above to create a (Java) project with your 
                Java class and (JUnit) unit test in Eclipse.</li>
            <li>If you've installed the latest Eclipse and Java, the JUnit package is going to be at 
                version 5, not version 4 as in the video. Don't worry about this. The example steps 
                will work fine with the latest updates. Do not roll back to version 4.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Add or edit your comments. At a minimum, each file and class and each method should 
                have <em>javadoc</em> style comments as follows:<br />
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                    <li>In the Eclipse editor, add a line above the class declaration ("public class 
                        JunitTesting").&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>On that new blank line type:&nbsp; &nbsp;/**<em>[return]&nbsp; &nbsp;(forward 
                        slash, asterisk, asterisk)<br /></em>When you hit the return key (after those 
                        3 characters, Eclipse will create the comment block for you.</li>
                    <li>Inside that new comment block, add a sentence or two with a description of what 
                        is in the file and the purpose for the class.</li>
                    <li>Add another line inside the comment block and add the tag "@author" with your name. 
                        It will probably autocomplete when you start typing.</li>
                    <li>Below that, add a line with a @version tag. For our purposes, you can use 
                        YYYY.MM.DD.nnn. For example, @version&nbsp; 2021.07.04.004 indicates the file was 
                        updated on July 4th, 2021 and was my 4th build on that day.</li>
                    <li>Just above each of your methods, in all of your .java source files, add a comment 
                        block as before. This time, Eclipse adds the @param and @return tags. Above those, 
                        add a sentence describing the purpose for the method and then describe the parameters 
                        and return values for the method on the appropriate comment lines.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Archive your project to a zipfile to submit. Right-click the project name from the Package 
                Explorer and choose Export from the menu. You can also select the project name and use the 
                File &gt; Export menu item. Expand 'General' and 'Archive File'. Use the Browse button to 
                specify and name and a destination for your zip file.</li>
            <li>(optional) If you have access to another computer, try copying your zip file there, unzip 
                the project and then import the project into Eclipse. I like to test my code on Windows and 
                macOS before publishing content.</li>
